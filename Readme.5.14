# StatStack Lite Debugging Log - May 14

## Initial Issue
The GameOver component was crashing on page refresh or when returning to the /game route, manifesting as:
- Blank blue screen
- TypeError related to accessing properties of null
- State restoration issues

## Initial State
- Game state (totalScore, picks, optimalScore, optimalPicks) was being persisted to localStorage
- GameOver component was trying to access data before full restoration
- No proper error handling or defensive programming in place

## Attempted Solutions

### 1. Type Definition Alignment
- Updated GameState interface in core/types/game.ts
- Aligned resultType definitions across components
- Added resultType to SavedGameState interface
- **Result**: Did not resolve the core issue

### 2. State Restoration Enhancement
- Added comprehensive state restoration in Game component
- Added validation guards for saved state
- Added default values for all state properties
- **Result**: Still experiencing initialization issues

### 3. Defensive Programming Implementation
- Added error states and handling
- Added default values for all destructured state properties
- Added try/catch blocks around critical operations
- Added user-friendly error UI with recovery options
- **Result**: Improved error handling but core issue persists

### 4. Initialization Flow Modification
- Added immediate game state initialization on component mount
- Modified setGameMode to handle initialization
- Added state verification after restoration
- **Result**: Still seeing initialization timing issues

## Current Issues
1. State Initialization Timing
   - Game state may not be properly initialized before component render
   - Possible race condition between initialization and state access

2. Type Errors
   - Still seeing "Cannot read properties of null" errors
   - Possible issues with null checks not catching all edge cases

3. State Restoration
   - Uncertainty about whether state is properly restored before access
   - Possible issues with localStorage data format or timing

## Next Steps to Consider
1. Review the initialization flow in App.tsx and ensure proper order of operations
2. Add state machine pattern to handle game state transitions more reliably
3. Consider adding a loading state at the router level
4. Review localStorage handling and possibly add versioning
5. Add more comprehensive error boundaries
6. Consider moving state initialization to a higher level in the component tree

## Current Implementation Details

### Game Component
- Handles initial state setup
- Manages state restoration from localStorage
- Provides error recovery UI
- Routes to appropriate game state

### GameOver Component
- Handles game completion state
- Calculates and displays final scores
- Manages optimal path calculation
- Provides share and restart functionality

## Environment
- React with TypeScript
- Zustand for state management
- Firebase for hosting
- Vite for build tooling
